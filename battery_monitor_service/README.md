# Battery Monitor for Robotics Cape
James Strawson - 2016


This battery monitor service is started automatically on boot by
battery_monitor.service in order to illuminate the set of 4 battery indicator
LEDS on the Robotics Cape to display battery charge level. It is primarily
intended to monitor the charge status of a 2-cell lithium battery plugged into
the white 3-pin JST-XH connector and light the indicator LEDs appropriately.

However, if a 2,3 or 4 cell lithium battery is connected to the DC input jack
and the white 3-pin JST-XH connector is left disconnected then it will
illuminate the battery indicator LEDs to reflect the charge status of the
battery connected to the DC input jack.

This is a service managed by systemd and should be stopped and started like
other linux services as follows:

```sh
root@beaglebone:~# systemctl stop battery_monitor
root@beaglebone:~# systemctl start battery_monitor
root@beaglebone:~# systemctl status battery_monitor
● battery_monitor.service - battery_monitor
